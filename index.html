        <h1>Wheighted Voronoi Stipples</h1>
        <p>Pointillism is the process of representing the tone of an image by drawing carefully selected points.    Using the Weighed Voronoi Stiplling algorithm, proposed by Adrian Secord in 2001, points can be placed in  order to give a more pleasing effect than with a regular grid.</p>
